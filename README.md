# Background
Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) captures atmospheric CO2 through the weathering of silicate materials. Increasingly, it is touted as a technical option, especially in agricultural systems, to sequester atmospheric C. Thus far, there are no published research on field-based validation of ERW in rice systems.

Previous work has shown that ERW can contributed to enhanced methanogensis (Zhang et al. 2024). Consequently, the net effect of ERW may be negative even with atmospheric C removal. Additionally, pot studies have suggested that metal cations are released into soils from weathering. Base cations can improve crop fertility, but release of excessive heavy metal species can toxic for human consumption (Uchibayashi et al. 2025).

# Objectives
Primary: Establish the effect of ERW on (1) methane emissions and (2) carbon capture through a dose response trial. Calculate net CO2eq balances. Overall, we hypothesise an increase in methane with ERW and increase in C capture with increasing rock application rates.

Secondary: Evaluate soil geochemical changes to soils, especially heavy metal concentrations. If specific metal species have high soils concentrations, proceed with elemental quantification in plant tissue.

# Treatments
Treatments include a low to high rate of rock amendment application
